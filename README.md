- 👋 Hi, I’m @RDennis1

MASc. Graduate from Ontario Tech University with a computer vision and deep learning background. My research interests lie in the intersection of these fields and intelligent transportation systems. Specifically, multi-camera object tracking and re-identification, road-user action recognition and anomaly detection, and spatiotemporal approaches for video object detection. I have a strong foundation in machine learning techniques. I am passionate about using these tools to solve real-world problems in transportation.

- 👀 I’m also interested in 
    - Generic Object Detection and Tracking, Semantic Segmentation, Image Classification, Temporal Action Localization, Action Classification, Video Understanding, Video Prediction, and Background Subtraction/Modelling from video.
